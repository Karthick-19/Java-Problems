Problem Statement 3: Expanding the Investigation
1. Beyond the Basics:
➢ Objective: Explore and choose one additional String Matching Algorithm besides Naive
Search and Boyer-Moore (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp).
➢ Guidance: Research and understand the chosen algorithm's core concept and how it differs
from Naive Search and Boyer-Moore. Resources like online tutorials or textbooks can be
